# sqlalchemy-challenge
I've decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with my trip planning, I decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that I need to take to accomplish this task. The resulting code can be accessed in the SurfsUp folder!

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. the results of this analysis can be seen in the Jupyter Notebook titled "climate_starter.ipynb"

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
In this section I design a Flask API based on the queries from Part 1! The script createtd can be seen in the python script titled "app.py"
